/*

	Scripting Overview (JavaScript is a type of scripting language)

	STATEMENTS
	Scripting is basically instructions for the computer to do something
	Each instruction ends in a semicolon ; and is called a statement
	Statements are like steps in the instructions and generally run consecutively
	Using a // means ignore the line - we call this a comment and the text goes grey
	There is a multiline comment surrounding all this text - note how it starts and ends

	BLOCKS
	We can group statements in between TWO curly braces {} which we call a block of code
	Sometimes, in our list of statements, we run or call blocks of code
	These execute (run) and then we go back to our original list of statements
	This means that the overall code does not necessarily run from top to bottom
	Examples of this are Functions where we call a block of code whenever needed
	And Loops where we repeat a block of code over and over for efficiencies
	We often even nest blocks of code within blocks of code {{}}
	But, within blocks of code, statements proceed from top to bottom ;-)

	PARTS OF A STATEMENT
	Within a statement, there are different parts - words and special characters
	These might be keyword commands belonging to the language (var, for, if, function)
	Or they could be operators - again belonging to the language (+,-,>,!)
	They could be identifiers that we have made up to label objects (myVar, winner)
	And they could be objects like numbers, strings, dates, etc. (7, "hello")
	You may hear the term Expression.  An expression is anything that has a value.
	"Hello" is an expression, x + 5 is an expression (operand operator operand)
	This is all getting a little too specific for me so let's carry on.

	SYNTAX
	When we code, there are only certain terms we can use and in certain order
	This is called the Syntax of the language
	If you use the wrong commands or use commands in the wrong way, you will get an error
	The error will show up in the command console (CTRL SHIFT I - to toggle the console)
	If code coloring is turned on (as it is in DreamWeaver) you should see:
		keywords in bold Blue
		browser objects in purple
		language objects and methods in green
		language properties in black
		number objects in red
		string objects in bright blue
		function declarations in bold Black
		operators in Blue
		brackets in bold Blue
		identifiers in black

	OBJECTS
	Objects and Object Oriented Coding is a great big important topic
	We will explore objects in detail in the next few lessons
	For now... objects are the things that we see or work with - like objects in life
	They have properties - location, color, text, rotation
	They have methods - things you can do with them or to them - play, open
	There are events that can happen to the object - click, complete, mouseover
	Pretty well everything that is not a keyword is an object
	The browser window is an object, the document is an object, a div is an object
	We can make custom objects but that is next term
	However, we will use custom objects made by others this term
	A slight variation in JavaScript is that strings, numbers and booleans are Primatives
	Primatives have no properties.  But JavaScript wraps the primatives in objects
	You probably will never have to worry about this ;-)

	LOGIC
	Aside from syntax and objects, there is what to do with the objects
	This is where we start to apply the rules of the environment and is indeed programming
	There are only a half dozen types of statements that we use over and over

	Here are some definitions and simple examples of the logical statements
	We will spend several lessons going over these and practicing them
	They will be used over and over again this year and in your scripting career!
	They are really wonderful - powerful puzzle pieces - truly magical
	However the syntax and various aspects are certainly tricky to start
	Do not worry - the will become second nature eventually!

	These are short examples - there are more indepth examples in the code further down

	Variable: a holder, a container with a label
	here we use the keyword var to declare a variable with an identifier x
	we assign the variable x the number 7 using the assignment operator

	var x;
	x = 7;

	// or all at once like this:

	var x = 7;

	Conditional: tests to compare the value of an expression
	here we use the if else keywords round brackets and curly brackets
	to make a conditional expression
	we use the comparison operator == to test if x is equal to 7
	we run the first block of code if the x == 7 Boolean expression is true
	we run the second block of code if the x == 7 Boolean expression is false
	these blocks of code could have many statements

	if (x == 7) {
		//do this;
	} else {
		//do this;
	}

	Function: declares a block of code to be run any time the function is called
	Here we declare a function with an identifier of test
	We collect a parameter (like a variable) called n
	And we define a block of code that does a conditional test on n
	If the test is true we return true and otherwise we return false
	return is a keyword that makes the function end and send back a value
	We can make functions without parameters
	We can make functions that do not return a value
	It depends on what we want the function to do
	Finally, we execute or run the function by using the identifier and ()
	Note, here we are passing the value of x into the function
	This means that we will be testing whatever x is
	x happens to be 7 from above so we have 7 * 5 = 35 which is less than 50
	So test(x) would have a value of Boolean false

	function test(n) {
		if (n * 5 > 50) {return true;}
		return false;
	}
	test(x);

	Loop: repeats a block of code while a condition is true
	here we loop starting with a variable i having a value of 0
	we keep looping as long as i is less than 10
	each time we finish a loop we add one to the value of i
	the i++ is a short form for i = i + 1
	each time we loop we do what is in the block of code
	so we would execute (call) the function makeMonster ten times

	for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
		makeMonster();
	}

	Array: is a list of variables each with an index that increases from zero

	var a = ["Dan", "Andrew", "Wasim", "Janice"];
	a[0]; // refers to the first element in the array "Dan"
	console.log(a[1]); // is a function that would display "Andrew" in the log window
	a[0] = "Dan Zen"; // this would assign "Dan Zen" to the first element of the array

	Object: is a collection of properties each with a value that we access via identifier

	var o = {name:"Dan Zen", occupation:"Inventor"}
	o["name"]; // has a value of "Dan Zen"
	o.name; // is the same thing and has a value of "Dan Zen"
	o["occupation"] = "Professor"; // would replace "Inventor" with "Professor"
	o.occupation = "Inventor"; // would put "Inventor" back into the occupation
	// there is no difference really in using the . syntax or the [] array access operator
	// the handy thing about the array access operator is that it takes a string
	// this means we can dynamically create what property we are asking for (more later)
	// the handy thing about the . syntax is that it is shorter

/*

	JAVASCRIPT

	JavaScript is a programming language that can be run in the Browser (and other places)
	Here we are in an HTML page and JavaScript runs between script tags
	To access objects in the browser we have to use an API - Application Program Interface
	We can control objects in the browser with the Web API for Window and Document
	We can access tags on the Web page using the DOM API (Document Object Model)
	These are traditionally considered part of JavaScript but recently have been separated
	They are still used in the same way as always, for instance:

	window.document.getElementById("logo").style.left = "0px";
	// or leaving off the default window to be the usual
	document.getElementById("logo").style.left = "0px";

	note the dot syntax - we access methods and properties of an object with a dot .
	more on objects, methods, properties and events a few lessons from now...

	We will access the DOM so we can demonstrate our programing
	The Web API and DOM API will be taught in the second half of AD1

	Most of our coding beyond this module will use two JavaScript libraries - CreateJS and ZIM js
	These will help us code for the HTML canvas tag
	On the canvas we do not use the DOM (traditional HTML tags like div, etc.)
	Rather CreateJS provides a Bitmap Object Model or a BOM with containers, shapes, Bitmaps, Text, etc.
	CreateJS provides robust commands for advanced interactivity
	like dynamic drawing, animation, dragging and dropping and hit tests
	ZIM js adds components, and simplifies a number of interactive requirements
	We will use these two libraries in the upcoming modules

	DEBUGGING

	When we code we often want to see what our code is doing and the values of our expressions
	We can do this with the console.log(); function
	We need to show the console - you can access the console through the Browser Developer Tools
	Or CTRL SHIFT I should toggle the console
	You can dock the console at the right of the browser
	console.log("hello"); // will write "hello" on the console.

	You can also use alert("hello"); to pop up an HTML alert box - but these get annoying
	And you can use document.write("hello"); to make the "hello" show up on the HTML page
	You will find that for more complex coding, it is easiest to use the console

*/

	console.log("hello world - long");
	console.log("hello world - short");

/*

	STYLES

	You can change the look and position of something with styles as in CSS
	These are the same styles that you will be learning in Web Design
	When accessing these styles with JavaScript you use the style property of the object
	and then the style name.  Note that hyphens are replaced with camelCase in JavaScript:

	obj.style.backgroundColor = "#AAAAAA";
	obj.style.borderBottom = "1px solid orange";

	Here we will set POSITIONING styles
	note: to use the left, top, bottom or right styles,
	we have to set the position style to absolute (or relative)
	we did this in the style tag up top
	we could have set it with code - much like we do below for left and top
	positions can be in units of px, %, em, etc. but I usually think in px
	note: if we do not set a unit for postion it will default to px

*/

	document.getElementById("logo").style.left = "100px";
	document.getElementById("logo").style.top = "100px";

	// ***** There are shorter ways to console.log(), document.getElementById() and accessing styles
	// ***** These will be shown in future modules using ZIM

function variables() {

	console.log("____1. VARIABLES____");

	// variables are used to hold a value so that we can use the value later
	// we can also change the value of the variable - that is why it is "variable"
	// values are objects like numbers, strings, dates, tags on the page, etc.
	// for example, we could store the user's name in a variable or their score, etc.

	// we can declare a variable using the keyword var which comes with the language
	// after var we put the name of the variable (its identifier) that we make up
	// the identifier must be one word using letters, numbers, _ or -
	// but it cannot start with a number
	// by convention, we start the variable with a lowercase letter
	// and we use camelCase if the variable name is two or more words
	// we then end the declaration statement with a semicolon ;

	var myVar;

	// a variable when declared has a scope of the location of the declaration
	// there is a scope section where we explore this further

	// to store (put) something in the variable we can assign it a value
	// here we use the assignment operator = to put the string "hello" into the variable myVar
	// we say, myVar equals hello

	myVar = "hello";

	// we can both declare and assign a value in one statement
	// here we declare a variable called num and assign it the number 1
	// we say, var num equals one

	var num = 1;

	// display the contents of the variable num to the console log
	console.log(num);

	// display the string num to the console log - see the difference?
	console.log("num");

	// display a description and the contents of num to the log
	// note that we use the + to join strings or strings and numbers (concatenation)
	// the + is used for addition when used between numbers only
	console.log("num = " + num);

	// you only need to declare a variable once
	// you can re-assign variables values any number of times

	num = 10; // now the num variable has a value of 10, not 1
	console.log(num);

	// a variable that has only been declared has a value of undefined
	var num2;
	console.log(num2); // undefined

	// if you try and access a variable that has not been declared
	// you get an error saying that the variable is not defined
	// console.log(num3);

	// see the difference?
	// the num2 variable is defined when you declare it
	// it is the value of num2 that is undefined - that's okay
	// it is not okay to try and access a variable that has not been defined
	// this gives an error

}


function conditionals() {

	console.log("____2. CONDITIONALS____");

	// conditionals test to see if a boolean expression is true
	// here are some expressions and how they would evaluate
	// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators

	false; 		// false
	1; 			// true
	0; 			// false
	-1; 		// true

	5 > 2; 		// true
	1 == 1; 	// true
	1 != 1; 	// false (note the not equal to)

	5 <= 2;		// false

	1 == true;	// true (as in this case, boolean true is converted to 1)
	3 == true;	// false (as in this case, boolean true is converted to 1)

	// we use the if keyword followed by two round brackets ()
	// what we are testing goes in the round brackets
	// we then follow this with a block of code between curly brackets {}

	// see if the value of variable test is equal to the number 1
	// note that the comparison operator is ==
	// we could say, if test equals one then output to the log
	// but to be safe, lets say, if test double equals one then output to the log

	var test = 1;

	if (test == 1) {
		console.log("we passed with a score of " + test);
	}

	// to do something else if the expression is not true then we use the else keyword

	} else {
		console.log("try harder");
	}

	// the boolean expression can be a compound expression
	// using && for AND and || for OR (pipe | is above the enter key)

function randomNumbers() {

	console.log("____3. RANDOM NUMBERS____");

	// a random number is a number from a range
	// for instance, some number between 1 and 10
	// it might be 8, 4, etc.  different each time
	// it could also be 1.588950050099 so we have to be careful

	// random numbers are what make the computer act like the real world
	// when combined with conditionals, they are like odds in real life
	// this combination is very very important in artificial intelligence and games

	// we can get a random number directly from the JavaScript Math class
	// we ask for its random() method which returns a random number from 0 to 1 but not including 1

	console.log(Math.random()); // this number has many decimal places - for example 0.682033025789775

	// here we use a conditional to write to the log half the time
	if (Math.random() > .5) {
		console.log("write to the log half the time");
	}

	// here we tell a secret if the random number is greater than .9 (only 10% of the time)

	if (Math.random() > .9) {
		console.log("tell the secret");
	} else {
		console.log("do not tell the secret");
	}

	// usually you do not need to convert the random number to anything else
	// but you can - for instance, here we get a random number from 0 to 10 (not including 10)

	console.log(Math.random()*10);

	// if we do not want the decimals we have three choices

	var noDecimals = 4.333;

	console.log(noDecimals);
	console.log("Math.floor() = " + Math.floor(noDecimals) ); // this simply removes the decimals
	console.log("Math.round() = " + Math.round(noDecimals) ); // this rounds the number up or down
	console.log("Math.ceil() = " + Math.ceil(noDecimals) ); // this rounds up to the nearest integer

	// here we make sure the random number is an integer (no decimals)
	// we should always Math.floor() random numbers to get equally proportioned chances
	// for instance if we rounded, the first and last numbers
	// would happen half as much as the middle numbers
	// we should not Math.ceil() because there is a chance the first number is exactly 0
	// so very very seldomly we could get 0 and most often we would get a bigger number
	// but if we Math.floor() it works out perfectly the chance of getting any number is equal

	var rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*10); // floor takes off the decimals
	console.log("0-9 : " + rand);

	// now, if we wanted a number from 1 to 10 including 1 and 10 we would do:
	rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*10) + 1;
	console.log("1-10 : " + rand);

	// the next part gets a little advanced, so do not worry if it is too much!

	// RANDOM RANGE
	// what if we wanted our random number to start at a number other than 0 or 1
	// so for instance, get a random number between 5 and 10 including 5 and 10
	// here is what we do - we calculate the total numbers in the desired range
	// so that would be 10 - 5 = 5 but if you check it could be 5,6,7,8,9,10
	// that is actually 6 numbers because we included both the start and end of the range
	// so if we want a random number between a and b
	// we would say the possible numbers would be b-a+1
	// so we take a random number from this by multiplying our answer times Math.random()
	// we need to Math.floor() the random number
	// in our example, that would give us either 0,1,2,3,4 or 5 but never 6
	// note that 0,1,2,3,4,5 are indeed six numbers
	// we then add the random number to the start number of the range - in our case 5
	// this is good that our random number might be 0
	// because some times we will get the first number in our range!
	// and if our random number was the highest (5) then we would get 5+5 = 10
	// and this is good because the highest number of our range is 10
	// so the final formula would look like this:
	// a + Math.floor(Math.random()*(b-a+1));

	var a = 5;
	var b = 10;
	var range = a + Math.floor(Math.random()*(b-a+1));
	console.log("random number between " + a + " and " + b + ": " + range);

function loops() {

	// a loop lets you repeat a block of code
	// usually if we want to do the same thing 3 or more times we use a loop
	// there are a few different types of loops, the most popular is the for loop
	// with a for loop you get an iterator which increments each time the loop runs
	// in other words, you get a variable that increases by 1 each time the loop runs
	// an iterator is a variable that we use to keep count
	// for example: the var i might start at 0 then go to 1 then 2 then 3, etc.
	// in actual fact, you can also make it decrease each time
	// or increase or decrease by 2 or by 3, etc, each time
	// just some information about increasing and decreasing numbers:

	var i = 0; 	console.log(i); // will show 0
	i = 1; 		console.log(i); // will show 1
	i = i + 1; 	console.log(i); // will show 2 : i was 1 and we add 1 to 1 to get 2 and assign it back to i
	i += 1;		console.log(i); // will show 3 : += adds the right side to the left side
	i += 3;		console.log(i); // will show 6
	i -= 3;		console.log(i); // will show 3 : -= subtracts from itself (also a *= and /=)
	i++;		console.log(i); // will show 4 : ++ is a shortform for add one to itself
	i--;		console.log(i);	// will show 3 : -- is a shoreform for subtracting 1 from itself

	console.log("careful with ++ operator");
	var careful = i++;
	console.log(i); // will show 4 because i has increased
	console.log(careful); // will show 3 because the assignment happened before the increase

	careful = ++i;
	console.log(i); // will show 5 because i has increased
	console.log(careful); // will show 5 because the assignment happened after the increase

	// syntax of for loop:
	// you use the for keyword followed by two round brackets
	// in the round brackets there are three parts
	// you specify the iterator variable and its starting value: var i=0;
	// you then specify the condition to keep looping: i<10;
	// finally, you specify what to do after each loop: i++
	// you DO NOT put a semicolon ; after the last one in the round brackets
	// after the round brackets, you put your block inside curly brackets {}
	// this block of code can be as many statements as you want
	// the block of code can also include more loops, functions, etc.

	// by convention, we use i as the first iterator in a loop
	// if we have a loop within a loop we use j and then k (usually no more nesting is required)
	// we have already declared var i above
	// but just so you can see how it usually looks - I will redeclare var i here:
	// we would not have had to, we could have just used i=0; etc.
	// re-declaring a var should generally be avoided as it is redundant
	// but there is no harm in JavaScript to declare again - in Flash you would get a warning

	console.log("let's do a loop from 0 to 4"); // if we used i<=5; then it would go to 5

	for (var i=0; i<5; i++) {
		console.log(i);
	}

	// the loop will run as long as the condition is true
	// so above, i starts at 0 and is increased every time the block of code runs
	// when i is 4, the block of code runs and the value of 4 is output to the log
	// then i is increased to 5 and because i is now not less than 5 (it is 5)
	// the loop stops and the code continues on from just after the loop (here)
	// you can use the break; statement inside a loop to stop the loop
	// for instance try adding if (i>2) {break;} to your loop and see what happens
	// you can also use the continue; statement to skip to the next iteration
	// if you added if (i==3) {continue;} to just before your console.log(i)
	// then the output would be 0, 1, 2, 4
	// continue; does not stop the loop, only ignore everything after it for that iteration


	// syntax of while loop
	// use the while keyword followed by two round brackets ()
	// inside the round brackets goes the conditional for looping
	// after the round brackets comes two curly brackets {} with our block of code
	// the loop checks the condition and if true, runs the block of code
	// the loop goes to the top again and checks the conditional, etc.
	// if the conditional is false, the code goes to after the loop

	var count = 0;
	while (count < 0) {
		console.log("while loop: " + count);
		count++;
	}

	// there is also a do... while... loop which is almost the same as a while loop
	// the do while loop runs the block of code first and then checks the condition
	// there is also a for... in... loop which loops through properties of an object
	// we will look at that later when we study object oriented programming

	// LOOP WITH A LOOP
	// here is an example of a loop within a loop
	// you might set up a grid of thumbnails this way - or a chessboard

	// advanced information ;-) so do not worry about this if everything is overwhelming!
	// there is a cool operator called the modulus %
	// the modulus can usually replace the need for nested loops
	// the modulus returns the remainder of a division of two numbers

	console.log("modulus");
	console.log( 9 % 3 ); // remainder is 0 as in 9/3 is exactly 3 with 0 left over (remainder)
	console.log( 10 % 3 ); // remainder is 1 as in 10/3 is equal to 9 with 1 left over
	console.log( 11 % 3 ); // remainder is 2
	console.log( 12 % 3 ); // remainder is 0
	console.log( 13 % 3 ); // remainder is 1 etc.

	// if the first number is less than the second number, it returns the first number

	console.log("modulus again");

	console.log( 1%3 ); // remainder is 1
	console.log( 2%3 ); // remainder is 2
	console.log( 3%3 ); // remainder is 0
	console.log( 4%3 ); // remainder is 1 etc.

	console.log( Math.floor(3/3) ); // remainder is 1
