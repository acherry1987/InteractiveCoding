PATTERNS

Just like in real life, patterns are something that repeats
Dots that repeat are a polka dot pattern ;-)
When we can make a template we have a pattern - as in a pattern for a dress
In coding it is the same - coding is made up of all sorts of patterns
A variable is a pattern for wanting to assign and change a value
A function is a pattern - for when we want to execute a block of code
A loop is a pattern - for when we want to repeat code consecutively
These patterns have been assimilated by the programming language
As such we do not refer to them as patterns but just the language

Below we will look at two patterns that help us code
1. Object Oriented Coding with Classes
2. Module pattern to separate our code from other code
3. Closures to keep local variables active


1. OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)

The object oriented pattern is such an established pattern that we usually consider it the language
It really is like a language on top of a language as it is written on top of the programming basics
First, a little history...

PROCEDURAL CODING

In the early days of coding we dealt primarily with numbers and strings (text)
To this day, in many languages (such as JavaScript) numbers and strings are called primitives ;-)
Coding was procedural and went step by step using a goto command to repeat code
As we started modeling (mimicking) life with code, we recognized life's patterns
Things in life are divided up into objects with properties and methods to do things
These patterns matched patterns in our main language with nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

OBJECT ORIENTED CODING

A main pattern - a meta pattern - is to recognize that there are patterns
So, we made a language in which objects can be made from patterns
The patterns in the language are called CLASSES
A class is the template from which an object is made
The class defines the properties and methods of an object - termed its members
Inheritance:
We also recognize that a base class can have sub classes and super classes
Sub and super just mean below and above referencing a hierarchy diagram with node 0 at top
A sub class has all the properties and methods of the base class plus its own
An object made from a class is said to inherit the members of the super class
Composition:
An object can be composed of properties - a person object is composed of a head, legs, etc.
The head, legs, etc. DO NOT inherit from the person as they are not a type of person
Rather the person is composed of these parts - this is composition, not inheritance
Classification lets us pick what to make and composition lets us make the object out of parts
More on this next term when we make our own custom classes and look deeper into the theory

OOP CONCLUSION

Object Oriented Programming was created by very logical people to model life
Hence it is very much a philosophy and I treat it as such (http://nodism.org)
OOP models life through a mix of classification and composition
Classification describes the types of things there are (this OR that)
Composition describes the parts of things (this AND that)

JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript uses objects and is an object oriented language
Everything with a value is an object - with the added clarification:
Keywords are not objects - they are the syntax of the language
null and undefined are not objects but rather primitives and represent absence of value
strings, numbers and booleans (true, false) are also primitives
but get automatically wrapped in objects called the same - so they can be treated as objects
Object, Function, Array, Date are examples of objects as are many API calls like document

We can make our own object as well and we quite often do!
There is no class statement or keyword in JavaScript as there is in "classical" OOP languages
This often leads people to "scoff" at JavaScript as not being a real OOP language
In truth, it is one generation behind (it is at 2 where other oop languages are at 3)
It may, in the future (my guess is in 2016) advance a level and include the class statement, etc.
However, we can define a class with no problem and use all the same object oriented techniques
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript
Indeed, JavaScript programmers have become proud of the flexibility of the language

CLASSES, OBJECTS, METHODS, PROPERTIES, EVENTS

A class is a template from which objects are made
For instance, a boat object is made from a Boat class, a person object from a Person class
The class defines the properties, methods and events of the object - its members
A property is like an adjective that helps describe the object (color, position)
or the property can be a noun that the object has (eyes, wheels)
A method is like a verb and describes what the object can do or have done to it (play, jump)
Events are a little more complex than properties or methods to define
but it is relatively easy to describe how to use them or why they are useful
Examples of events are user clicks or timers completing
Certain objects will dispatch events
Certain objects can listen for events that are dispatched
For instance, we can make a button listen for a click event
We "listen" for the event with code and then call a function to "handle" the event
With coding, nothing happens unless there is an event

EXAMPLE

An object is an independent "instance" of the class with its own property values
For example there could be a Ball class which defines a color property and a kick() method
We can then make a new ball object that has red for the color property
We can make a second ball object that has blue for the color property
The objects have the same property but independent values for the property
The methods are for the balls are the same but they act independently too
We can kick the second ball but perhaps not kick the first ball
The ball object may dispatch an event when the ball is finished rolling after a kick (not shown)
The ball objects are separate but they are both classified as balls (made from a Ball class)

Below, we use a function to create a Ball class (note the upper case class - by convention)
We use the new keyword to create an object from the Ball class
When we use new, the function (called the constructor) is run and an object is returned
Also, the object is assigned to the keyword "this" used in the function

*/

console.log ("____1.  OBJECT ORIENTED_____");

var Ball = function(c) { // this function is called the constructor when run with "new"
	this.color = c;
	console.log (this.color + " ball is made");
	this.kick = function() {
		console.log("kick " + this.color + " ball");
	}
}

var redBall = new Ball("red");
var blueBall = new Ball("blue");
blueBall.kick();

// note, we cannot access c outside of the function but we can access this.color
console.log("redBall.c = " + redBall.c); // undefined
console.log("redBall.color = " + redBall.color); // red
console.log("-----------------"); // divider


/*

One drawback of defining the kick function inside the ball class function
is that it would get created for every object made from the class function
A better way is to define the kick function on the "prototype" of the class function
A prototype is a blank object that is automatically made when you declare a function
You can replace it with any object you want or add properties and methods to the blank object
Objects made from the constructor are automatically given reference to the prototype object
This is through the keyword __proto__ and deligation is automatically set up
Deligation means that if a property is not found on the object it will look in its __proto__ object
So if we store the kick function on the prototype object, it gets made once
but we can use it from any object created from the class!
There are more handy things we can do with a prototype but that is in the advanced topic

*/


var Ball = function(c) { // this function is called the constructor when used with "new"
	this.color = c;
	console.log (this.color + " ball is made");
}

Ball.prototype.kick = function() {
	console.log("kick " + this.color + " ball");
}

var greenBall = new Ball("green");
var purpleBall = new Ball("purple");
purpleBall.kick();
console.log("-----------------"); // divider


// COMPLETE JAVASCRIPT CLASS EXAMPLE
// Here is a more complete example of making objects in JavaScript:
// it is not a real world example but rather uses the terminology as identifiers
// The example also gets into the advanced concept of ENCAPSULATION
// We will discuss this more at the start of next term
// but in general, it means that we only "expose" code that we need to
// anything that we can keep private, we do - that way, there is less chance of error
// in a sense, our code works like a black box with only input and output
// it does not matter how it works inside and you can't break it!


var Class = function() {

	console.log("hello from Class");

	this.publicProperty =  "Hello";

	var privateProperty = "Secret";

	var that = this;

	// can only call from within constructor
	function privateMethod() {

		// scope of this inside private method is window - (bug?)
		console.log("privateMethod " + that.publicProperty); // good
		// console.log("privateMethod " + publicProperty); // error
		// console.log("privateMethod " + this.publicProperty); // undefined

		console.log("privateMethod " + privateProperty); // good
		// console.log("privateMethod " + this.privateProperty); // undefined
		// console.log("privateMethod " + that.privateProperty); // undefined
	}
	// this will be the first to log after the hello from Class
	privateMethod();

	// can call from outside constructor (hence it is a public method)
	// gets defined for every object made
	// and hence closure gives it access to each object's private members
	this.privilegedMethod = function() {
		// scope of this withing privilaged method is the object (yay!)
		console.log("privilegedMethod " + this.publicProperty);
		console.log("privilegedMethod " + privateProperty);
	}

}

// here is a public method
// this method only gets defined once (but can be used by many objects)
// it can even be made to have a different scope than an object from the defining class
// this public method does not have access to the private members
// it only has access to the public members
// it could gain access to private members through a privilaged method
// remember, a privilaged method is public with access to private members
Class.prototype.publicMethod = function() {
	console.log("publicMethod " + this.publicProperty);
	// console.log("publicMethod " + this.privateProperty); // undefined
}

var class1 = new Class();
console.log("publicProperty " + class1.publicProperty);
// console.log("privateProperty " + class1.privateProperty); // undefined
// class1.privateMethod(); // error not a function
class1.privilegedMethod();
class1.publicMethod();

function Static() {
	//Static.count = Static.count | 0; // can use bitwise operator on integers
	Static.count = Static.count || 0; // initiates count only if undefined (or 0)
	Static.count++;
	console.log("count = " + Static.count);
}
Static.receiveCount = function() {return Static.count;}
// console.log("static " + Static.receiveCount()); // undefined
// Static.count = 7;
new Static();
new Static();
new Static();
console.log("from Static method count = " + Static.receiveCount());
console.log("-----------------"); // divider


/*

ADVANCED JAVASCRIPT

INHERITANCE

In addition to ENCAPSULATION mentioned above...
one of the most powerful features of Object Oriented code is INHERITANCE
Inheritance means we can define properties and methods in a base class
and pass them down to a sub class which is said to "extend" the base class.
The sub class can then add its own properties and methods.
And the sub class can be a base class for another sub class.
From the viewpoint of the sub class, the base class is called a super class.

In JavaScript there is no "extends" keyword as in classical OOP languages
Instead, JavaScript uses prototype objects to pass down the properties and methods

CONSTRUCTOR AND PROTOTYPE

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain

All objects are created from a constructor function with the "new" keyword
The constructor function is also the class definition function
And as such gets a capital letter at the start by convention

Object(), Array(), String(), Number(), Date(), Ball() are constructor functions
Literals - [] and {} also run constructor functions Array() and Object()

Each of these constructor functions has a prototype property
The prototype property points to the prototype object which will be inherited.
When we make a new object from a constructor function,
the new object references the prototype object (using a keyword, __proto__)
the new object will deligate to the prototype object
This means if a property is not found on the object, it looks in the prototype
and therefore inherits its properties

*/

Object.prototype.photoBomb = "oops - sorry!"; // add a property to the Object prototype

var myObject = {};
console.log("from object: " + myObject.photoBomb); // now all objects made will have this property

/*

The above is not a good idea as not all objects need a photoBomp property!
All objects have an __proto__ property that points to the prototype object of its parent
This __proto__ property is not available in all browsers so use with caution

NOTE:

There is an important difference between the prototype property of a function
and the __proto__ property of an object:
The prototype property of a function points to the prototype object that WILL BE inherited
The __proto__ points to the prototype object that WAS inherited

All the built-in objects in JavaScript inherit the prototype object of the default object
For example, the Array inherits the prototype object of the default object
myArray below will inherit the prototype object of the Array and of the default object
This is called the prototype chain

*/

var myArray = [];
console.log("from array: " + myArray.photoBomb);

/*

JavaScript will look for an own object called photoBomb and will not find it
so it looks in the Array's prototype object and not find it
so it will look in the Object's prototype object and find it there where we put it

EXAMPLE

Here we make a class and a sub class that inherits from the class

*/

var Bag = function() {
	console.log("we have a Bag");
}

Bag.prototype.openBag = function() {
	console.log("open bag");
}

var Purse = function() {
	console.log("we have a Purse");
}

// inherit all the Bag properties
Purse.prototype = new Bag();
Purse.prototype.constructor = Purse; // just incase something asks

// then add any methods to the purse
Purse.prototype.zip = function() {
	console.log("zip purse");
}

var myPurse = new Purse();

myPurse.openBag();
myPurse.zip();
console.log("from myPurse: " +  myPurse.photoBomb); // just for the fun of it!

// because the prototype property refers to an object you can do this:
// make an object that holds a function and a property
var o = {sayBoo:function(){console.log("BOO!");}, name:"Zorg"};

var Ghost = function() {
	console.log("I am a Ghost called " + this.name);
}
Ghost.prototype = o;

var g1 = new Ghost();
g1.sayBoo();

// Just be a little careful as the object is shared by all Ghosts
// really, we would want the Ghost names to be unique so do not store it on the prototype
// rather store it in the class definition using this - this.name

var g2 = new Ghost(); // hey... it has the same name!

console.log("-----------------"); // divider

/*

GOTCHAS

A prototype object is just an object, and as such, it too has a prototype object
that being the default object's prototype object ;-)
A constructor function is a function so it's __proto__ property is a function()
The __proto__ property of that is the default object's prototype object

FIRST WRITE-UP ATTEMPT (REFERENCE)

JavaScript is a prototype based language - prototypes are used when making new objects
A prototype is an object {} that holds default properties and methods for the object
In the beginning, there was one object - the default object's prototype object
The default object is defined with a constructor function (more on that below)
The constructor function holds a reference to prototype object
If we make a new object {}, it gains access to the default object's prototype object

JavaScript makes objects like Function and Array from the default object
In doing so, the new objects are given access to the default object's prototype object
As well, the new objects are automatically given their own prototype object
So now, the new objects are roughly the same as the default object to start
JavaScript then adds new properties and methods to the prototype objects of the new objects
For instance, the length property and the push() method of the Array
This is termed augmenting the prototype (adding things to it)

A prototype is an object that is referenced by any objects of the same type
Every object gets a prototype object as its companion (next to or on the same level) (prototype)
Every object was made with reference to its parent's prototype object (one level up) (__proto__)
The exception is the default object which is at the very top and has no parent
This establishes a prototype chain going up levels
When JavaScript checks to see if an object has a property, it looks right up the prototype chain
for instance, all Arrays share a prototype object, all Boat objects a Boat prototype object
that is unless the prototype object is replaced with another object
in which case all older objects would share the old prototype object
any new objects would share the new prototype object
usually we do not replace a prototype object
but rather we change or add to the original prototype object's properties and methods
Prototypes are how we handle inheritance in JavaScript
We will make custom objects with inheritance in term 2

It should be noted:
The prototype keyword is only available on a function itself (not an object made from the function)
This is because the members of the prototype object are automatically associated
with an object made from the function.  If you need to find out what that prototype was,
you can access it throught the object's constructor property  myObject.constructor.prototype

CONSTRUCTOR

A constructor is a function that runs when we make an object
In JavaScript a class is a function and that function is the constructor
When you define a function it gets a prototype object
the prototype object has one property - a constructor property pointing back to the function
When you run the function using the new keyword, and an object is made and returned
The new object will be given a reference to the function's prototype object
and therefore inherit all properties and methods of the function's prototype (and its prototype, etc.)
The constructor function will be run and return the object
A keyword this in the constructor refers to the object

*/


// 2. MODULES

// Modules are sometimes called Name Space emulators
// often when someone distributes code they wrap it in a module like below
// this allows the distributer to set a unique identifier for all their code
// any variables and functions are declared in this scope
// they will not polute the global scope
// in other words, they will not overwrite other variable or function names nor be overwritten
// you then access any of the variables or functions using the module identifier followed by a dot .

// Note: the function is immediately called (immediately invoked)
// that is accomplised by putting two round brackets after the function body (block of code)

console.log ("____2.  MODULES_____");

var MODULE = function(module) {
	module.variable = "module variable value";
	module.test = function() {
		console.log("hi from MODULE test()");
	}
	return module;
} (MODULE || {});
console.log(MODULE.variable);
MODULE.test();


// or declare the module and assign the module from within
// here we use the object literal to assign functions and variables
// note the object literal syntax of : and ,
// this is how CreateJS works - the earlier formation is fine though

var MODULE2 = MODULE2 || {};
(function() {
	var test = 2;
	var submodule = {
		variable: "module variable value",
		test: function() {
			console.log("hi from MODULE2 test() " + test);
		}
	}
	MODULE2.SUBMODULE = submodule;
} ());
MODULE2.SUBMODULE.test();




// note in the above case we can't use the function() operator as the start of a statement
// because JavaScript gets mixed up with the function declaration
// so we can wrap the function in round brackets
// or we could place a character infront of the function like ! or a + or a -
// commonly used is the () but contrary popular information, this does not really mean anything

// if you have a module and want to augment the module - add things to it
// then there is an issue that the values of the local variables will not be passed on
// because each new closure gets its own local variables
// you cannot access the local variables from the last closure from within a new closure
// even if you have not closed that closure - the closure starts at the function operator
// however, for the most part you just do not want outside functions changing your local variables
// so it is usually okay to be able to read the local variables
// here is a loosely augmented module pattern with augmented local variables
// the variables are stored in a local object called locals
// the variables are readable as a JSON string via the public readLocals variable

var LOCALS = function(module) {
	var locals = JSON.parse(module.readLocals || "{}");

	locals.var1 = 7;
	locals.var2 = 8;
	module.test = function() {
		console.log("hi from LOCALS test()");
	}

	module.readLocals = JSON.stringify(locals); // do after updating any local variables
	return module;
} (LOCALS || {});
LOCALS.test();

var LOCALS = function(module) {
	var locals = JSON.parse(module.readLocals || "{}");

	locals.var2 = 2;
	locals.var3 = 3;
	module.locals = function() {
		console.log("hi from LOCALS locals()");
		console.log(locals.var1 + " " + locals.var2 + " " + locals.var3);
	}

	module.readLocals = JSON.stringify(locals); // do after updating any local variables
	return module;
} (LOCALS || {});
LOCALS.locals();



// 3. CLOSURES

// A closure is an excecuted function that holds local variables using the var keyword
// these local variables are generally cleared once the function stops running
// An inner function can access the local variables
// If we assign this inner function to a variable outside the closure function
// then the closure function will not end and it keeps the local variables alive
// In a sense, this allows for a static type variable to be available for the inner function
// Static is an OOP term that means it belongs to the class as opposed to objects made from the class
// It accomplishes what a global variable can do - but it does not pollute the global scope

// Closure is perhaps the wrong word as what is causing this to happen is more like a lack of closure
// the local variables might still be used - non-closure?

console.log ("____3.  CLOSURES_____");
console.log ("press logo to see count");

zss("logo").cursor = "pointer"; // just to show that logo can be clicked

// long way:
/*
function counter() {
	var count = 0;
	return function() {
		console.log(++count);
	}
}

var doCount = counter();
zid("logo").onclick = doCount;
*/

// medium way
//zid("logo").onclick = counter();

// short way
zid("logo").onclick = function() {
	var count = 0;
	return function() {
		console.log(++count);
	}
}();


// we run the outer function using the () at the end
// it is the return value that is assigned to the onclick
// the return value is the inner function definition
// the inner function makes use of the local var in the outer function
// so that local var is kept alive even after the outer function runs
// but note - the outer function only runs once
// so the count var is declared as 0 only once
// the inner function runs on every click of the logo to increase count
