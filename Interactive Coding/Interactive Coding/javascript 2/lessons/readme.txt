
The LESSONS folder includes four modules:

Programming Basics, Basic Patterns, Interactive Basics and Building Basics

You can see these from the index.html page

In each module, the menu provides links to a main page with all the code

Then there are practice pages - one made for you and the rest you make yourselves

This encourages you to practice setting up pages and doing code yourselves

These lessons were prepared for Sheridan Interactive Media 2014/2015 by Dan Zen

The supporting libraries: CreateJS and ZIMjs are found in the code directory

You should link to the CDN versions at http://createjs.com and http://zimjs.com

The local versions will allow you to do all the examples offline if necessary

All the best - happy Interactive Coding!
